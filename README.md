# df-log-viewer-h

Convenient (hopefully) viewer for announcements of 
[Dwarf Fortress game](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) .

I did the starting bulk push ahead of time, so with the start of the war, 
I am not sure if github.com will be accessible.
Almost everything is ready, except for reencoding of some characters,
and many parsing rules are not done.

The app heavily relies on Francisco Vallarino [Monomer framework], and 
in principle, it can run on Windows, Linux and macOS.

## Installation

On windows you can use [this binaries]().

To build from source, follow similar 
[instructions](https://github.com/fjvallarino/monomer/blob/main/docs/tutorials/00-setup.md) 
for Monomer
